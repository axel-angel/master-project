how colors handled/feeded into CNN?

grayscale may be better for ImageNet? (sRGB, YUV worse?)

multi-stage networks? connection by-pass layers?

no papers on ImageNet for invariance testing, t-SNE?

use methods of invariance measure (paper) for our study?

explore t-SNE for input versus in-layer output, MNIST too easy?
ImageNet too big?
PCA pre-process how many dimensions?
how many images?
learn PCA/t-SNE on separated set train/test?

deep belief network? auto-encoders? pre-train/unsupervised learning layerwise?

CNN on NLP not very clear (blog, document vector, unsupervised?)
